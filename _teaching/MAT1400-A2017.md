This is the first course where students learn about multivariable calculus. The covered subjects start with sequence and series, before going into functions of more than one variables. We cover multivariable differential calculus (partial derivative, differentials, gradient, chain rule, level surfaces, optimisation, Lagrange multipliers) before introducing multivariable integral calculus (Iterated integrals, Fubini's theorem, change of variables, Jacobians). My duties included designing and teaching the class, creating and marking exams, holding office hours and general administration of the course. The class consisted of two sections of 200 students.

Suites, séries. Fonctions de plusieurs variables, continuité, dérivées partielles, différentielles, plan tangent, dérivation en chaîne. Gradient, surfaces de niveau, extremums. Intégrales multiples, changement de variables, jacobien.
