In this course, students put the theory of Riemann integration on a rigorous basis. The covered subjects include Riemann integration, the fundamental theorem of calculus and sequences and series of functions, including Taylor series, exponential and trigonometric functions and their inverses, as well as Fourier series. My duties included conducting a weekly exercise session, holding office hours and marking exams.
