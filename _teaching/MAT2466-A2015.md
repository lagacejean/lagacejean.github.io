In this course, students learn about some applications of analysis. The covered subjects include Fourier series, the Sturm-Liouville problem, Fourier transforms, separation of variables for partial differential equations, other sets of orthogonal functions and special functions. My duties included conducting a weekly exercise sessions and holding office hours.
