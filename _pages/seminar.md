### Reading group at UCL : "The Steklov problem"

## The next meeting of the reading group is on Friday, December 6th, Room 414

* Paper : [A. Fraser, R. Schoen, Sharp eigenvalue bounds and minimal surfaces in the ball, Invent. Math (2016)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00222-015-0604-x) 
 * We will continue with the existence and regularity of maximising metrics for the first normalised Steklov eigenvalue.
