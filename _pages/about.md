I am currently a Research Associate at University College London, working with [Leonid Parnovski](http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahlep/) and Alexander Sobolev. I finished my Ph. D. at Université de Montréal in August 2018, working under the supervision of [Iosif Polterovich](http://www.dms.umontreal.ca/~iossif/). My interests are in asymptotic analysis, mainly in the fields of spectral theory, elliptic PDEs, and geometry of numbers. I am more specifically interested in situations where there are more than one asymptotic parameter, and how their relations affect the behaviour of the problem. The following type of questions are of particular interest to me.

* Can we describe the spectrum of a periodic, quasi-periodic or almost-periodic operator in the presence of resonators, or in very thin media?
* Given a sequence of optimisers for the k'th eigenvalue of an elliptic operator, can we ensure that this sequence converges in any meaningful sense to a limit object?
* Given an anisotropically expanding convex domain, under what conditions on this anisotropicity can we meaningfully count the number of lattice points contained inside.
* Consider a sequence of domains perforated with smaller and smaller holes distributed uniformly inside, a process known as homogenisation. What is the behaviour of boundary spectral problems, such as the Steklov problem, in this limit? Can we use this to make links between different eigenvalue problems?

To answer these questions, I use tools from operator theory, classical PDEs, harmonic analysis and analytic number theory.
