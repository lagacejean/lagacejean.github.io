The Single Layer, Double Layer, and Steklov operators share many similarities.  For example, the boundary plays a main role in all three.  However, there are already striking differences with how their eigenvalues behave when we look at a circle.  In this survey talk, we discuss each operator and it's spectral properties.  We start with relating the operators to each-other via decomposition and jump relations.  Next, we discuss eigenvalue asymptotics, comparing with some of the few known explicitly computed examples, and state other known geometric facts.
