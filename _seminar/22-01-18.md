We will quickly review the material presented in the first talk and focus on studying barcodes of Morse functions in greater depth. This will allow us to sketch the proof of the main theorem from the first talk and if time permits discuss additional applications and examples. The talk is based on a joint work with Iosif Polterovich and Leonid Polterovich.
